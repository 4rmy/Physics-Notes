## 24-1 Electric Potential
- The electric potential $V$ at a point $P$ in the electric field of a charged object is $$V=\frac{-W_{\infty}}{q_0}=\frac{U}{q_0}$$
	where $W_{\infty}$ is the work that would be done by the electric force on a positive test charge $q_0$ were it brought from an infinite distance to P, and U is the electric potential energy that would then be stored in the test charge–object system.
- If a particle with charge $q$ is placed at a point where the electric potential of a charged object is V, the electric potential energy $U$ of the particle–object system is $$U=qV$$
- If the particle moves through a potential difference $\Delta{V}$, the change in the electric potential energy is $$\Delta{U}=q\Delta{V}=q(V_f-V_i)$$
- If a particle moves through a change $\Delta{V}$ in electric potential without an applied force acting on it, applying the conservation of mechanical energy gives the change in kinetic energy as $$\Delta{K}=-q\Delta{V}$$
- If, instead, an applied force acts on the particle, doing work $W_{app}$, the change in kinetic energy is $$\Delta{K}=-q\Delta{V}+W_{app}$$
- In the special case when $\Delta{K}=0$, the work of an applied force involves only the motion of the particle through a potential difference $$W_{app}=q\Delta{V}$$

## 24-2 Equipotential Surfaces and the Electric Field
- The points on an equipotential surface all have the same electric potential. The work done on a test charge in moving it from one such surface to another is independent of the locations of the initial and final points on these surfaces and of the path that joins the points. The electric field $\vec{E}$ is always directed perpendicularly to corresponding equipotential surfaces.
- The electric potential difference between two points $i$ and $f$ is $$V_f-V_i=-\int_i^f\vec{E}\cdot{d}\vec{s}$$
	where the integral is taken over any path connecting the points. If the integration is difficult along any particular path, we can chose a different path along which the integration might be easier.
- If we chose $V_i=0$, we have, for the potential at a particular point, $$V=-\int_i^f\vec{E}\cdot{d}\vec{s}$$
- In a uniform field of magnitude $E$, the change in potential from a higher equipotential surface to a lower one, separated by distance $\Delta{x}$, is $$\Delta{V}=-E\Delta{x}$$

## 24-3 Potential Due to a Charged Particle
- The electric potential due to a single charged particle at a distance $r$ from that charged particle is $$V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r}$$
	where $V$ has the same sign as $q$
- The potential due to a collection of charged particles is $$V=\sum_{i=1}^nV_i=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{q_i}{r_i}$$
	Thus, the potential is the algebraic sum of the individual potentials, with no consideration of directions.

## 24-4 Potential Due to an Electric Dipole
- At a distance $r$ from an electric dipole moment magnitude $p=qd$, the electric potential of the dipole is $$V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{p\cos\theta}{r^2}$$
	for $r\gg{d}$; the angle $\theta$ lies between the dipole moment vector and a line extending from the dipole midpoint to the point of measurement.

## 24-5 Potential Due to a Continuous Charge Distribution
- For a continuous distribution of charge (over an extended object), the potential is found by (1) dividing the distribution into charge elements $dq$ that can be treated as particles and then (2) summing the potential due to each element by integrating over the full distribution $$V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\frac{dq}{r}$$

## 24-6 Calculating the Field from the Potential
- The component of $\vec{E}$ in any direction is the negative of the rate at which the potential changes with the distance in that direction $$E_s=-\frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{s}}$$
- The $x$,$y$, and $z$ components of $\vec{E}$ may be found from $$E_x=-\frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{x}}; E_y=-\frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{y}}; E_z=-\frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{z}}$$
	When $\vec{E}$ is uniform, all this reduces to $$E=-\frac{\Delta{V}}{\Delta{s}}$$
	where s is perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces.
- The electric field is zero parallel to an equipotential surface.

## 24-7 Electric Potential Energy of a System of Charged Particles
- The electric potential energy of a system of charged particles is equal to the work needed to assemble the system with the particles initially at rest and infinitely distant from each other. For two particles at separation $r$, $$U=W=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r}$$
## 24-8 Potential of a Charged Isolated Conductor
- An excess charge placed on a conductor will, in the equilibrium state, be located entirely on the outer surface of the conductor.
- The entire conductor, including interior points, is at a uniform potential.
- If an isolated conductor is placed in an external electric field, then at every internal point, the electric field due to the conduction electrons cancels the external electric field that otherwise would have been there.
- Also, the net electric field at every point on the surface is perpendicular to the surface.
