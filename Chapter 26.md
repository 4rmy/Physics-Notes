## 26-1 Electric current
- An electric current $i$ in a conductor is defined by $$i=\frac{dq}{dt}$$ where $dq$ is the amount of positive charge that passes in time $dt$
- By convention, the direction of electric current is taken as the direction in which positive charge carriers would move even though (normally) only conduction electrons can move.
$$q=\int_0^tidt$$
- $1$ ampere $=1$ A = $1$ C/s
- The current into a junction must equal the current out.

- $i_0=i_1+i_2$
## 26-2 Current Density
- Current $i$ (a scalar quantity) is related to current density $\vec{J}$ (a vector quantity) by $$i=\int\vec{J}\cdot{d}\vec{A}$$ and
 $$J=\frac{i}{A} \tag{uniform current density}$$
 where $d\vec{A}$ is a vector perpendicular to a surface element of area $da$ and the integral is taken over any surface cutting across the conductor. The current density $\vec{J}$ has the same direction as the velocity of the moving charges if they are positive and the opposite direction if they are negative.
- When an electric field $\vec{E}$ is established in a conductor, the charge carriers (assumed positive) acquire a drive speed $v_d$ in the direction of $\vec{E}$.
- The drift velocity $\vec{V}d$ is related to the current density by $$\vec{J}=(ne)\vec{v}_d$$ where $ne$ is the carrier charge density.

## 26-3 Resistance and Resistivity
- if we apply the same potential difference between the ends of geometrically similar rods of copper and of glass, very different currents result. The characteristic of the conductor that enters here is its electrical resistance. The resistance $R$ of a conductor is defined as $$R=\frac{V}{i}$$ where $V$ is the potential difference across the conductor and $i$ is the current through the conductor. Instead of the resistance $R$ of an object we may deal with the __resistivity__ $\rho$ of the material $$\rho=\frac{E}{J}$$
- The reciprocal of resistivity is __conductivity__ $\sigma$ of the material $$\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}$$
- Resistance is a property of an object. Resistivity is a property of a material. The resistance $R$ of a conducting wire of length $L$ and uniform cross section is $$R=\rho\frac{L}{A}$$
- The resistivity $\rho$ for most materials changes with temperature. For many materials, including metals, the relation between $\rho$ and temperature $T$ is approximated by the equation $$\rho-\rho_0=\rho_0\alpha(T-T_0)$$ Here $T_0$ is a reference temperature, $\rho_0$ is the resistivity at $T_0$, and $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity for the material.

## 26-4 Ohm's Law
- __Ohm's law__ is an assertion that the current through a device is always directly proportional to the potential difference applied to the device. $$I:V$$ or $$ I=\frac{V}{R}$$
- A conducting device obeys Ohm's law when the resistance of the device is independent of the magnitude and polarity of the applied potential difference.
- A conducting material obeys Ohm's law when the resistivity of the material is independent of the magnitude and direction of the applied electric field.
- The assumption that the conduction electrons in a metal are free to move like the molecules in a gas leads to an expression for the resistivity of a metal: $$\rho=\frac{m}{e^2n\tau}$$ Here $n$ is the number of free electrons per unit volume and $\tau$ is the mean time between the collisions of an electron with the atoms of the metal.
- Metals obey Ohm's law because the mean free time, $\tau$, is approximately independent of the magnitude $E$ of any electric field applied to a metal.
