## 27-1 Single-Loop Circuits
- An emf device does work on charges to maintain a potential difference between its output terminals. if $dW$ is the work the device does to force positive charge $dq$ from the negative to the positive terminal, then the emf (work per unit charge) of the device is $$ \mathscr{E} = \frac{dW}{dq}\tag{definition of $\mathscr{E}$}$$
- An ideal emf device is one that lacks any internal resistance. The potential difference between its terminals is equal to the emf.
- A real emf device has internal resistance. The potential difference between its terminals is equal to the emf only if there is no current through the device.
- The change in potential in traversing a resistance $R$ in the direction of the current is $-iR$; in the opposite direction it is $+iR$ (resistance rule).
- The change in potential in traversing an ideal emf device in the direction of the emf arrow is $+\mathscr{E}$ in the opposite direction it is $-\mathscr{E}$ (emf rule).
- Conservation of energy leads to the loop rule: _Loop Rule. The algebraic sum of the changes in potential encountered in a complete traversal of any loop of a circuit must be zero_.
	Conservation of charge leads to the junction rule:
	_Junction Rule. The sum of the currents entering any junction must be equal to the sum of the currents leaving that junction_.
- When a real battery of emf $\mathscr{E}$ and internal resistance $r$ does work on the charge carriers in a current $i$ through the battery, the rate $P$ of energy transfer to the charge carriers is $$P=iV$$ where $V$ is the potential across the terminals of the battery.
- The rate $P_r$ at which energy is dissipated as thermal energy in the battery is $$P_r=i^2r$$
- The rate $P_{emf}$ at which the chemical energy in the battery changes is $$P_{emf}-i\mathscr{E}$$
- When resistances are in series, they have the same current. The equivalent resistance that can replace a series combination of resistances is $$R_{eq}=\sum_{j=1}^nR_j\tag{$n$ resistances in series}$$
