## 25-1 Capacitance
- A capacitor consists of two isolated conductors (the plates) with charges +q and -q, Its capacitance C is defined from $$q=CV$$ where V is the potential difference between the plates.
- When a circuit with a battery, an open switch, and an uncharged capacitor is completed by closing the switch, conduction electrons shift, leaving the capacitor plates with opposite charges.

## 25-2 Calculating the Capacitance
- We generally determine the capacitance of a particular capacitor configuration by (1) assuming a charge $q$ to have been placed on the plates, (2) finding the electric field $\vec{E}$ due to this charge, (e) evaluating the potential difference V between the plates, and (4) calculating $C$ from $q=CV$. Some results are the following:
	- A parallel-plate capacitor with flat parallel plates of area $A$ and spacing $d$ has capacitance $$C=\frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}$$
	- A cylindrical capacitor (two long coaxial cylinders) of length $L$ and radii $a$ and $b$ has capacitance $$C=2\pi\epsilon_0\frac{L}{\ln(\frac{b}{a})}$$
	- A spherical capacitor with concentric spherical plates of radii $a$ and $b$ has capacitance $$C=4\pi\epsilon_0\frac{ab}{b-a}$$
	- An isolated sphere of radius $R$ has capacitance $$C=4\pi\epsilon_0R$$
