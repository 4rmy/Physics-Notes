## Coulomb's Law
- 2 types of charge
	- Positive (protons, removing electrons)
	- Negative (electrons)
	When talking about charge, either adding or removing electrons
- Electrons
	- Fundamental particles
	- Every electron is perfectly identical
- Quarks
	- Fundamental particles
	- Up quarks
	- Down quarks
	- Strange quarks

| Proton                             | Neutron                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Up quark (+$\frac{2}{3}$ charge)   | Up quark (+$\frac{2}{3}$ charge)   |
| Up quark (+$\frac{2}{3}$ charge)   | Down quark (-$\frac{2}{3}$ charge) |
| Down quark (-$\frac{2}{3}$ charge) | Down quark (-$\frac{2}{3}$ charge) |

- Particles with the same sign of electrical charge repel each other, and particles with opposite signs attract each other.
- Semiconductors are materials that are intermediate between conductors and insulators; examples include silicon and germanium in computer chips
- Superconductors are materials that are perfect conductors, allowing charge to move without any hindrance
### Coulomb's law
- Permittivity constant
	$\epsilon_0=8.85*10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N^2} * m^2$
- Coulomb constant
	$K=8.99*10^9 N*\frac{m^2}{C^2}$
- Coulomb's Equation
	$f=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$
- Multiple Forces
	- If multiple electrostatic forces act on a particle, the net force is the **vector sum** (not scalar sum) of the individual forces.
		$\vec{F}_{1,net}=\vec{F}_{12}+\vec{F}_{13}+\vec{F}_{14}+\vec{F}_{15}+...+\vec{F}_{1n}$
- Electric charge is quantized
- The charge of a particle can be written as $ne$ where
	- $n$ is a positive or negative integer
	- $e$ is the elementary charge
	- Any positive or negative charge $q$ that can be detected can be written as $q=ne$
	- $e$ is approximately $e=1.602*10^{-19} C$.
- Charge is conserved
- if two particles undergo an annihilation process, they have equal and opposite signs of charge
