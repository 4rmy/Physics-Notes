## 23-1 Electric Flux
- The electric flux $\phi$ through a surface is the amount of electric field that pierces the surface.
- The area vector $d\vec{A}$ for an area element (patch element) on a surface is a vector that is perpendicular to the element and has a magnitude equal to the area $dA$ of the element.
- The electric flux $d\phi$ through a patch element with area vector $d\vec{A}$ is given by a dot product
	$d\phi{}=\vec{E}\cdot{}d\vec{A}$
- The total flux through a surface is given by
	$\phi=\int\vec{E}\cdot{}d\vec{A}$    (total flux)
	where the integration is carried out over the surface
- The net flux through a closed surface (which is used in Gauss' law) is given by
	$\phi=\oint\vec{E}\cdot{}d\vec{A}$    (net flux)
	where the integration is carried out over the entire surface

## 23-2 Gauss' Law
- Gauss' law relates the net flux $\phi$ penetrating a closed surface to the net charge $q_{enc}$ enclosed by the surface
	$\epsilon_0\phi=q_{enc}$    (Gauss' Law)
- Gauss' law can also be written in terms of the electric field piercing the enclosing Gaussian surface
	$\epsilon_0\oint\vec{E}\cdot{}d\vec{A}=q_{enc}$    (Gauss' Law)

## 23-3 A Charged Isolated Conductor
- An excess charge on an isolated conductor is located entirely on the outer surface of the conductor.
- The internal electric field of a charged, isolated conductor is zero, and the external field (at nearby points) is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude that depends on the surface charge density $\sigma$
	$E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$

## 23-4 Applying Gauss' Law: Cylindrical Symmetry
- The electric field at a point near an infinite line of charge (or charged rod) with uniform linear charge density _𝜆_ is perpendicular to the line and has magnitude
	$E=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0r}$    (line of charge)
	where _r_ is the perpendicular distance from the line to the point.
- $\lambda=Q/L$

## 24-5 Applying Gauss' Law: Planar Symmetry
- The electric field due to an infinite nonconducting sheet with uniform surface charge density _σ_ is perpendicular to the plane of the sheet and has magnitude
    $E=\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$    (nonconducting sheet of charge)
- The external electric field just outside the surface of an isolated charged conductor with surface charge density _σ_ is perpendicular to the surface and has magnitude
    $E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$    (external, charged conductor)
    Inside the conductor, the electric field is zero.

## 23-6 Applying Gauss' Law: Spherical Symmetry
- Outside a spherical shell of uniform charge _q_, the electric field due to the shell is radial (inward or outward, depending on the sign of the charge) and has the magnitude
    $E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}$    (outside spherical shell)
    where _r_ is the distance to the point of measurement from the center of the shell. The field is the same as though all of the charge is concentrated as a particle at the center of the shell.
- Inside the shell, the field due to the shell is zero.
- Inside a sphere with a uniform volume charge density, the field is radial and has the magnitude
    $E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{R^3}r$    (inside sphere of charge)
    where _q_ is the total charge, $R$ is the sphere’s radius, and $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the sphere to the point of measurement.
