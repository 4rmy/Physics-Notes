## Electric Field
- Particles know where another particle is because they create electric fields at their position
- Test charges are always positive
- $E=\frac{F}{q_0}=\frac{kQ}{r^2}$
- Electric field lines
	- Extend away from +
	- Travel towards -
	- Electric field vectors must be tangent to the field line at that point and in the same direction
	- Lower density field lines = lower magnitude (r>)
	- Electric field lines set up by a positively charged particle all point away from the particle, whereas electric field lines set up by a negatively charged particle all point toward the particle.
- Electric fields due to a dipole
	$E=\frac{1}{2\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{qd}{z^3}=\frac{1}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{p}{z^3}$
	$E=\frac{qz}{4\pi\epsilon_0(z^2+R^2)^\frac{3}{2}}$
